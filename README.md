Features
Report Lost Items: Users can submit information about items they have lost, including item name, description, location where it was lost, and optionally, an image of the item.

Retrieve Found Items: Users can browse through items that have been found and reported by others. They can view details of these items and claim them if they believe it belongs to them.

Claim Process: For items marked as "found", users can go through a simple checkout process to claim the item. This includes providing their name, address, and payment details if required.
